# Skit

A self-hosted dashboard that lets you watch and download music and videos from YouTube.
No third-party services, no restrictions—just a simple interface that does what it’s supposed to.

It's only a fun project I built over the weekend. The code is messy and needs to be refactored, but it works.

## Features

🎵 Watch & Download – Stream videos and music or save them locally.

🚀 Self-Hosted – You run it on your own machine, no external dependencies.

🔍 Search & Discover – Look up songs and videos directly in the dashboard.

⚡ Fast & Minimal – No bloat, just a clean UI and efficient performance.

## Install

root@root:~# unzip skit.zip
root@root:~# cd skit 
root@root:~# npm install 
root@root:~# node server.js # Run server on localhost:3000
```


## Why?

Because I wanted a simple way to manage media contents without relying on third-party websites or apps.
This gives me full control, and now, if anyone else finds it useful, that’s a bonus.
