# Skit

A self-hosted dashboard that lets you watch and download music and videos from YouTube.
No third-party services, no restrictions—just a simple interface that does what it’s supposed to.

It's only a fun project I built over the weekend. The code is messy and needs to be refactored, but it works.

## Features

 - Watch & Download – Stream videos and music or save them locally.

 - Self-Hosted – You run it on your own machine, no external dependencies.

 - Search & Discover – Look up songs and videos directly in the dashboard.

 - Fast & Minimal – No bloat, just a clean UI and efficient performance.
